# Doggo Generator

Doggo Generator is an app that displays a random dog picture on each click from the [dog.ceo API](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random).

## Technology

Doggo Generator was my first independent React app, that was set up initially using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) boilerplate.

## Learnings
- Setting up a React project using CRA
- Fetching data from URL and converting the response to JSON
- Displaying the image with a newly generated image URL on click
